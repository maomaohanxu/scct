Selection detection by conditional coalescent tree
===================================================

SCCT [#]_ (\ **S**\ election detection by \ **C**\ onditional \ **C**\ oalescent \ **T**\ ree) is a
efficiency computational software developed to detect recent 
positive selection using deep sequencing data. It's robust to various demographic events and also robust
to the variations of mutation rates and recombination rates. This method is also a powerful method, which has power
comparable to iHS [#]_ method. SCCT, however, improved the ability to pinpoint selective causal sites, facilitated with 
other variant annotations, which can greatly help geneticists to explore the mechanisms behind positive selection events.
